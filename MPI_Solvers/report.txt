Summary of Gaussian Elimination Algorithm:
The folllowing is done for each iteration while creating the upper triangular matrix.
The partial pivoting is done by the master process and is swapped to create the pivot row.
Now the rows are partitioned among the processes and the variables are eliminated in those rows in parallel.
Once the upper triangular matrix is created, we can get the final values of X by performing back substitution. 

Summary of Conjugate Gradient Algorithm:
The standard algorithm is followed. The main parallelism is done while computing the Matrix Product Ap
The rows of A are partitioned among the different processes.


The Time Comparisons for the 2 methods are as follows:
For a Symmetric Positive Matrix A of size 1000x1000 running using 10 processes.
CG Takes ~1 second
While Gaussian Elimination takes ~14 seconds.

This is because Conjugate Gradient has much lesser computation and the memory overhead for broadcasting is significantly less.
